# Mozilla Add-On Packages for AUR

This repository collects packages to globally install [add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/) for [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/) software, such as [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) and [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/thunderbird/), via [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org/)'s [User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/). They are all built and installed in a similar way, so collecting them here eases maintenance.
