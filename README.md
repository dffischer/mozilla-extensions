# Mozilla Add-On Packages for AUR

This repository collects packages to globally install [add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/) for [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/) software, such as [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) and [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/thunderbird/), via [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org/)'s [User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/). They are all built and installed in a similar way, so collecting them here eases maintenance.


## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. If you want to use the templates to package other extensions, feel free to fork this repository and add them. Pull requests are much appreciated.

Simple version updates do not necessarily need to be checked in.
